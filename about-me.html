    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a senior at Edmonds College pursuing a degree in Information Technology 
      with a focus on Application Development and Cloud Computing. Through my coursework 
      and cohort projects, I have built a strong foundation in software development, 
      cloud infrastructure, and modern deployment practices.

    <p>
      My academic experience has given me hands-on exposure to developing applications, 
      working with cloud platforms, and applying best practices in system design and security. 
      I enjoy solving complex problems, building scalable solutions, and learning emerging 
      technologies that drive innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I prepare to transition into my professional career, I am excited to apply my 
      technical skills, collaborative mindset, and passion for continuous learning to 
      real-world projects. I am especially interested in opportunities where I can 
      contribute to cloud-native application development, infrastructure automation, 
      and software engineering.
