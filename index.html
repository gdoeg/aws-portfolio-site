      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a senior at Edmonds College pursuing a degree in Information Technology 
        with a focus on Application Development and Cloud Computing. Through my coursework 
        and cohort projects, I have built a strong foundation in software development, 
        cloud infrastructure, and modern deployment practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        My academic experience has given me hands-on exposure to developing applications, 
        working with cloud platforms, and applying best practices in system design and security. 
        I enjoy solving complex problems, building scalable solutions, and learning emerging 
        technologies that drive innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I prepare to transition into my professional career, I am excited to apply my 
        technical skills, collaborative mindset, and passion for continuous learning to 
        real-world projects. I am especially interested in opportunities where I can 
        contribute to cloud-native application development, infrastructure automation, 
        and software engineering.
